    "Three feature extractor functions and two classifier models were built in this project. The first model is a simple model that classifies gender based on the first letter of a given name, the second model classifies gender based on the bigrams of characters in a name, the third model classifies gender based on the trigrams of characters in a name, and all of these three are Naïve Bayes Classifier models. To see if a different classifier yields better output, a decision tree classification model is run at the end based on the character trigram features."

    "Use of trigram features result in an increase in the accuracy score to 79.4%. This is slightly higher than the accuracy of the bigram model and is the best accuracy score achieved so far after fine tuning the model three times. This score means that the trigram model accurately predicts the gender almost 80% of the time based on a given name. According to the model’s most informative features, character trigrams like “ett”, “Ros”, “Dor”, and “ina” are more likely to be present in female names by 17.0, 15.9, 14.6, and 14.5 times respectively than that in male names.

    "The trigram model [section 3] performed better in most metrics compared to the baseline model [section 1] in this project. The precision score at which the baseline model predicts for female is 64% and for male is 61% whereas it is 82% for female and 75% for male in the trigram model. This means that the percentage of correctly predicted instances over the amount of correct and incorrect predictions is higher in the trigram model for both genders. Similarly, the recall for the baseline model is 95% for female and 12% for male whereas it is 86% for female and 68% for male in the trigram model, which means that the percentage of correctly predicted instances over the amount of total predictions is higher for female and lower for male in the baseline model compared to the trigram model. In both models, the recall is higher for female predictions and higher recall is generally considered good. The f-1 score represents harmonic mean of both precision and recall. It is difficult to maximize both precision and recall at the same time, but we can do that in an easier way with the f-1 score metric. The f-1 score is higher for both female and male in the trigram model, with scores of 84% for female and 71% for male compared to 77% for female and 20% for male in the baseline model. "
